How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    You can see the changes that were made to the document

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It would save a lot of time tracking bugs and any changes and help overall organisation

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    It would make more logical sense and represent an autonomous and complete change.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is designed for code so can cater for multiple dependant files. Google docs is not.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log shows all the commit history. git diff shows the actual differences between different commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You would have a safety net so to speak. You could create a branch off the master line and you could experiement there and not worry about breaking anything

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    saving and tracking projects
